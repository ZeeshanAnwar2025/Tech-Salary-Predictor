## 📓 Notebook Pipeline (salary_analysis.ipynb)

| Step | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Step 1 | Load Dataset |
| Step 2 | Basic EDA — shape, dtypes, missing values |
| Step 3 | Data Cleaning — duplicates, missing values, normalization |
| Step 4 | Filter Tech Jobs only |
| Step 5 | Visualizations — histograms, countplot, heatmap |
| Step 6 | Feature Engineering — encoding, scaling |
| Step 7 | Model Building — Random Forest Classifier |
| Step 8 | Evaluation — accuracy, F1, confusion matrix |
| Step 9 | Save cleaned CSV + model pkl |
| Step 10 | Retrain as **Regressor** + save full bundle for Streamlit |
